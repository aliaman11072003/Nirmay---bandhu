Problem Statement Title	
Queuing models in OPDs/ availability of beds/ admission of patients. A hospital based solution is ideal which can be integrated with city wide module
Description	
Technological solution as per queuing models in OPDs/availability of beds/admission of patients would be one area. Study of dispensation of various types of medicines/consumables and Inventory management modules at hospital level are key areas requiring support. NIC has already developed some modules but their implementation in Delhi is yet to be started. A hospital based solution is ideal which can be integrated with city wide module may be required.

Queuing Models in OPDs, Bed Availability, and Patient Admissions: A Hospital-Based Solution
Problem Statement ID: 1620
Problem Statement Title:
Queuing models in OPDs/availability of beds/admission of patients. A hospital-based solution is ideal which can be integrated with a city-wide module.

Description
The project aims to develop a comprehensive technological solution that addresses key challenges faced by hospitals in managing patient flow, bed availability, patient admissions, and inventory of medicines and consumables.

The solution will be based on queuing models in Outpatient Departments (OPDs) and provide real-time insights into bed availability and patient admissions. The project will also explore efficient inventory management systems to ensure the availability of necessary medicines and consumables at all times.

Though some modules have been developed by the NIC, their implementation in Delhi is pending. Our solution will build on this, aiming to integrate with the existing city-wide hospital management system.

Key Focus Areas:
Queuing Models in OPDs: Optimizing patient wait times and improving service delivery.
Bed Availability Management: Real-time tracking of bed occupancy and availability.
Patient Admission System: Streamlined and automated patient admission processes.
Inventory Management: Efficient tracking of medicines and consumables to avoid stockouts.
City-Wide Integration: Ensuring seamless integration with city-level health management systems for enhanced coordination.
Organization
Client: Government of NCT of Delhi

Features
Dynamic OPD Queuing System: Implements advanced queuing models to minimize patient wait times and ensure better resource allocation.
Bed Availability Dashboard: Real-time status of bed availability in different hospital departments, including emergency and ICUs.
Automated Patient Admission: Digitized and automated patient admission workflow to reduce manual intervention.
Inventory Management Module: Real-time tracking of stock levels for medicines and consumables to prevent shortages.
City-Wide Integration Capability: The solution can be expanded to integrate with the city-wide health module to offer a holistic view of hospital resources.
